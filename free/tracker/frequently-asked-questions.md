# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are my enchants being wiped when a goal is reached?

You have an invalid enchantment in goals.yml. The default configuration is built for 1.16, so you need to use enchants that are valid for your server version.\
\
For example, efficiency would be:\
**1.8** DIG\_SPEED:1\
**1.16** efficiency:1\
\
Use the Bukkit names for 1.8-1.12\
Use the actual names for 1.13+

### Why is the tracker getting stuck?
