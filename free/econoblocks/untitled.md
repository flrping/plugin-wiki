# Installation & Dependencies

## Download

You can download Econoblocks from Spigot and Songoda Marketplace.

## Version Support

**Econoblocks** only supports versions 1.8.8 and above. Support for 1.7 and below will most likely never be added.

## Dependencies

**Econoblocks** currently depends on Vault and an appropriate Economy Manager to fully function. Meaning, you must have it installed in order for the plugin to work.

Some other plugins you may add to enhance the experience:

* ItemsAdder
* Oraxen
* MMOItems
* TokenManager
* PlayerPoints
* DecentHolograms
* PlaceholderAPI
